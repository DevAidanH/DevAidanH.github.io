# Rock Paper Scissors
This project is a Rock Paper Scissors browser game that can be used on desktop, tablet or mobile thanks to its responsive design. I started this project at college when I was first learning JavaScript. The project was written in pure HTML and styled with basic CSS. The functionality of the game is coded in vanilla JavaScript. This project allows users to click buttons to choose rock paper or scissors to try and beat the computerâ€™s randomly generated choice. It is has a responsive mobile design. To play and test this game go to aidanh.github.io and start by clicking one of the three buttons at the bottom.
